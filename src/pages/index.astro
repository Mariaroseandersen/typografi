      <i>Shape words differently</i> was born out of a project during my studies as a digital designer. The assignment was to create a custom font, and I set out to design something unique that would combine boldness with friendliness. <br /><br />To gather ideas, I explored a lot of inspiration online, particularly on Pinterest, where I found myself drawn to round, soft, and bubble-like shapes. These curvy forms felt playful and approachable, which led me to focus on creating a font with these characteristics. I created a moodboard to collect my thoughts and guide the design process. <br /><br />From there, I began sketching each letter carefully in Adobe Illustrator, ensuring the shapes remained consistent and fresh, while still feeling clean and modern. <i>Shape words differently</i> is
      the result of combining creativity with the challenge of designing something that is both bold and inviting.
